# DSM Kernel Parameters

Synology uses a custom fork of the Linux kernel to power DSM. It has a lot of great improvements. Some of them deal with
being useful for any NAS while others are feature-flags for their hardware. This document lists and describes 
more useful/interesting flags present in their kernel(s). Keep in mind this is **not** a definitive list. 

See `kernel/syno_bootargs.c` for a complete list of options for a given kernel.
