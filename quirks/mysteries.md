# Mysteries

Some things aren't known - this is a raw dev-brain-dump for such things. Feel free to add anything or correct anything.

### Some serial ports are needed
Source: https://xpenology.com/forum/topic/6253-dsm-61x-loader/

- Without any serial ports present in the system weird things are happening (tty dying and respawning, possibly other).
[Jun's patch](../Jun%20loader/jun.patch) contains a workaround which changes `console output` to `console none` for
multiple DSM services.

- Additionally, it looks like you need `console=ttyS0,115200n8` in the kernel line for some reason.

- He also mentioned: "Automatically apply workaround for boards without serial port."


### USB hot plug is not functional (some models)
In particular DS3617xs kernel refuses to do any USB hot plug (or even ethernet) when booted without a loader:

```

In comparison, in a normal case when a flash drive is inserted or usbcore is laoded when one is already present kernel 
should print something akin to:

```

```

Currently the reason is unknown. To debug it on a VM (here: Proxmox) create a dummy image and use:
```
losetup -P /dev/loop2 /home/ttg/dsm-research/ds-dsm/dummy-usb-image.bin
qm monitor 123
drive_add 1 id=dummyusb,file=/dev/loop2,if=none,format=raw,cache=none,aio=native,detect-zeroes=on
device_add usb-storage,id=dummyusb,drive=dummyusb,bootindex=2,removable=on
```

### S/N Validation
There seems to be a code in the GPL kernel which does some sort of S/N and MACs validation. See `mtdpart.c`.

### GPIO Chip
On kernels v4.4.x (e.g. 918+) an reasonably well-looking GPIO chip is needed (using `gpiochip_add()`). This is not 
needed nor exists on v3.10.
